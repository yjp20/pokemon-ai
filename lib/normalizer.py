"""
Module to normalize the gamestate to be used in various ML bot implementations.
The output of the normalize function results in the desired features ranging
from 0 to 1 as is the standard for pytorch.

The normalized array has the following structure:

index => value

0 => is ally active faster than opp active
1 => percent of my unknown pokemon [0, 1]
2 => percent of opp unknown pokemon [0, 1]

for each pokemon of active [ally, opponent]:
    0 => percentage of unknown moves [0, 1]
    1 => level [60, 100]
    2 => health percentage [0, 1]
    3 => bug type
    4 => dragon type
    5 => electric type
    6 => fighting type
    7 => fire type
    8 => flying type
    9 => ghost type
    10 => grass type
    11 => ground type
    12 => ice type
    13 => normal type

    15 => psychic type
    16 => rock type
    17 => water type
    18 => is poisoned
    19 => is toxiced
    20 => is burned
    21 => is paralyzed
    22 => is confused
    23 => is frozen
    24 => is sleeping
    25 => base attack [0, 350] (logistic curve)
    26 => base defense [0, 350] (logistic curve)
    27 => base special [0, 350] (logistic curve)
    28 => base speed [0, 350] (logistic curve)
    29 => real attack [0, 1300] (logistic curve) (only for attack, divide by 2 if burned) (multiply based on modifiers)
    30 => real defense [0, 1300] (logistic curve) (*2 if reflect)
    31 => real special [0, 1300] (logistic curve)
    32 => real speed [0, 1300] (logistic curve) (only for speed, divide by 4 if paralyzed)
    33 => attack modifier [-6, 6]
    34 => defense modifier [-6, 6]
    35 => special modifier [-6, 6]
    36 => speed modifier [-6, 6]
    37 => used_protect (whether or not they used protect last turn)
    38 => is_leech_seeded
    39 => is underground (using dig)
    40 => is in the sky (using fly)
    41 => is recovering (after using hyper beam or something)
    42 => is charging (using sky attack or something)

    for each move of pokemon (4 times):
            0 => move1 power (if multi-hit, pls do weighted average based on probabilities) [0, 200] (*2 manually if earthquake and opp is digging) (logistic regression !!!!!)
            1 => move1 pp remaining [0, 1]
            2 => move1 acc of current pokemon [0, 1]
            3 => move1 crit chance [0, 1]
            3.5 => move1 predicted % health damage [0, 1] (use RANDOM = 0.9)
            4 => move1 will it kill the enemy pokemon? (for damage calc, assume RANDOM = 0.9)
            5 => move1 bug type
            6 => move1 dragon type
            7 => move1 electric type

            47 => move1 recovers_health (1 if recover or soft-boiled, -1 if not) (the only other health recovering move, rest, is otherwise taken care of)
            48 => move1 is_reflect
            49 => move1 copies_opp_move
            50 => move1 damages_based_on_level (night shade, seismic toss)
            51 => move1 is_rest
